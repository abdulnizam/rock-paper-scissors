Mavericks- Developer Assignment 3 - Rock Paper Scissors Information

# User Story:
    As a frequent game player,
    I’d like to play rock, paper, scissors
    So that I can spend an hour of my day having fun.

# Objective
    ● ​I should be able to play Player vs Computer.
    ● ​I should be able to play Computer vs Computer.
    ● ​Each new game should be a different game.

### (Don’t know the game? ​h​ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock​paper​scissors​)

# Technical constraints:
    ● ​Doesn’t necessarily need a flashy GUI.
    ● The solution should be easily runnable from the command line.
    ● ​Third​-party or external libraries should only be used for tests.

# Front-end and Mobile Devs:
    To help you visualize the game and reduce the amount of time necessary to finish the assignment we provide a draft of what the UI can look like. Please take a look at the screens and consider them as guidelines.

# Things to consider

    Run and/or ​build instructions are seen in a positive light​, as it indicates you know how to work in that environment. Mention setup and execution instruction in a README file.

    We’re not too bothered with the UI. However, if you are mostly a ​frontend or mobile engineer a nice UI is a requirement​.

    We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product. As a guide, ​elegant and simple​ wins over feature-rich every time.

    Do you ​test drive your code​? This is something we value and we will be looking for telling indicators of such in the code you produce.

    Do you care about how ​easy is for others to understand your code? Try to think if others would easily pick up from where you left.

    We also ​consider the extensibility of the code produced. A well-factored code should be relatively easily extended. ​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock​paper​scissors​lizard​Spock ​may be a natural extension.

    Follow ​the principles and general conventions of your programming language of choice. Use the language which you feel most comfortable with, but please do ​refrain from using esoteric languages​.

    We are expecting a ​well-modelled solution​. Additionally, any indicator of design (​DDD, or design patterns) would make us smile.

    queries or clarification, please reach out to us at ​humans@mavericks-consulting.com​.
